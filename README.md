# Blefonix RolePlay Web

The next-gen [Blefonix RolePlay](https://brpsa.vercel.app) web services repo. Home, docs and other things! Powered with [mdx](https://mdxjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and true dreams.

The project was deployed so that Blefonix RolePlay players would be able to find the necessary information about the server in a quick way. Also, anyone can edit and improve this repo. This means that the docs, for example, will always remain up-to-date.

[This website](https://brp.vercel.app) and [this](https://brpsa.vercel.app) should not be confused with [this one](https://rp.blefonix.com). The last is a discussion website. It's a place to discuss various things related to the game server.

## Docs

- React components, markdown, i18n and theming support.
- Docs with automatically generated sidebar and anchor links.
- Docs with built-in syntax highlighting and file-system based routing.
- Project also includes image optimization, and other awesome features.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Frontend

### Local Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

Use it for code formatting:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
# or

```
